            <p>
              I'm a New York City-based software engineer, driven by a desire to create impactful products that
              help people. Although my background lies in educatioin, I'm fueled by a deep love for problem-solving, building,
              and finding creative solutions.<br /><br />
              
              I'm proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Express,
              Node, various SQL and NoSQL databases, GraphQL, HTML, and CSS.
              Additionally, I've gained experience with Cypress and Jest for
              testing, demonstrating my commitment to quality assurance. <br /><br />
              
              My background in communication and education
              instilled in me the importance of understanding diverse needs and
              fostering supportive environments. These transferable skills,
              coupled with my strong work ethic and unwavering enthusiasm, make
              me a valuable asset to any team. I'm particularly drawn to environments that
              value diversity, collaboration, and continuous learning. <br /><br />
              
              In my free time, you can find me
              curled up with a good book (readying for my annual Goodreads goal
              of 30!). Additionally, I'm passionate about canine nutrition and
              creating personalized meals for my chunky English Bulldog, Stanley. <br />
