            <p>
              I'm a software engineer based in New York City and a former
              teacher. My transition to software engineering was truly a
              revelation. It mirrored the aspects of teaching that initially
              drew me in ‚Äî the opportunity to empower individuals with knowledge
              and witness their growth. I derive immense fulfillment from
              coding, as it allows me to create something from scratch or
              enhance existing solutions. Just as I embraced the challenge of
              guiding and nurturing students, I thrive on the coding challenges,
              whether it's debugging or finding innovative solutions. <br />
              <br />

              My experience as a dev has equipped me with a robust understanding
              of engineering principles and the resilience needed to navigate
              the complexities of development. What excites me the most about
              being a software engineer is the opportunity to contribute to
              products that make a positive impact. I deeply admire
              organizations that leverage technology for meaningful change, and
              I am eager to be a part of such initiatives.<br />
              <br />

              I specialize in technologies like GraphQL, React, JavaScript,
              TypeScript, Express, Node.js, SQL, and NoSQL databases. As I
              embark on my journey in the tech industry, I am seeking a
              full-stack role that allows me to blend my unique blend of
              educational experience with my passion for software
              engineering.<br />
              <br />

              Let's build a future where technology becomes a catalyst for
              positive change!
